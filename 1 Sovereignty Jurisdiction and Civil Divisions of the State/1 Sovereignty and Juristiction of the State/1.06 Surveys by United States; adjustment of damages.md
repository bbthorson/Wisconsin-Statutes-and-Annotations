====================================================

The person may erect on the lands any signals, temporary observatories or other small frame structures, establish permanent marks of stations, and encamp on the land. The person is liable for all actual damages done thereby. If the amount of the damages cannot be agreed upon by the person, or any representative of the federal government, and the owner or occupant of the lands entered upon, either of them may petition the circuit court for the county in which the lands, or any part of them, are situated for the appointment of a day for the hearing of the parties and their witnesses and the assessment of the damages. The hearing shall be held at the earliest practicable time after 14 days' notice of the time and place is given to all the parties interested in the manner the court orders. The damages may be assessed by the court with or without a view of the premises. If the damages assessed do not exceed the sum tendered the occupant or owner of the land, the person who made the tender shall recover costs; if they are in excess of that sum, the other party shall recover costs, which shall be allowed and taxed in accordance with the rules of the court.
